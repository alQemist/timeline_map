#timeline_map

This project uses d3.js to modify and existing SVG found at https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19. 

The goal was to enhance the map with animation and create an interactive timeline which shows the progression of COVID-19 cases in the Czech Republic.

Features:
 - Mouseover the Date heading to update the map to a given day in the range
 - Mouseover any bar in the bar graph to update the map to a given day
