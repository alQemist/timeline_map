#timeline_map

This project uses d3.js to modify an existing SVG found at 
https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19. 

Data for the new cases reported by day was used for creating the timeline and can be exported from this location
https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/api/v2/covid-19/obce.json (1GB)

The goal was to enhance the map with animation and create an interactive timeline which shows the progression of COVID-19 cases in the Czech Republic.

Features:
 - Mouseover the Date heading to update the map to a given day in the range.
 - Mouseover any bar in the bar graph to update the map to a given day.
